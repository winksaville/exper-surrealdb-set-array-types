# exper-surrealdb-set-array-types

Experiment with surrealdb to set and array types.

At what a "set" was it's basically a list of values where each
is unique (i.e. different from all other values). In contrast
an array doesn't care what the contents are and can have values
where are a duplicate of other values.
